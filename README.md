# Stop-Moodle-PDF-Download
A Chrome extension to prevent automatic PDF downloads on Moodle.

Have you ever downloaded the same PDF file multiple times because moodle automatically downloads it every time you open it? This extension prevents that from happening by removing the 'forceDownload' parameter from the URL.
Now you can open the PDF in your browser without cluttering your downloads folder while still having the option to download it manually.
